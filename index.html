            There are many hill stations in India but the best one is Nainital. It is in U.P. I went to Nainital on a
            school tour in summer holidays. We stayed there for ten days. We enjoyed boating and walking on the banks of
            the lake. This is the only lake in Nainital. In the morning when the sun is rising and in the evening when
            it is setting the whole place looks very nice. In the night, the lake looked very beautiful. Hotels in
            Nainital are very good. By going to Nainital we were saved from the hot summer and also we saw a nice hill
            station. I was happy to spend my vacations in Nainital. When I came back I told about my trip to everyone.
